# Portfolio
This is my personal portfolio, made to share my credentials and experience. Made in React.js

## Why React.js?
Even though this specific portfolio can be made in pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript (which I did; it can be seen in the old-version branch(https://github.com/robert-arias/robert-arias.github.io/tree/old-version)), and, the way the portfolio is structured, a Single Page Application (SPA) is not needed. I just chose React to practice. 
Is this the best approach? I don't think so; other frameworks are available for this purpose. For portfolios, as far as I've read, people are against React.js for its SEO optimization problems. I don't mind, though.

### Changes
Most of the design from the old portfolio were kept; the main changes were made on the landing page, navigation, and buttons.
