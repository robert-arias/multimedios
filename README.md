# Portfolio
This is my personal portfolio, made to share my credentials and experience. Made in React.js

## Why React.js?
Even though this specific portfolio can be made in pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript (which I did; it can be seen in the [old-version branch](https://github.com/robert-arias/robert-arias.github.io/tree/old-version)), and there's no need for React.js (because the portfolio itself is a SPA). I chose to make it with React.js, because, besides the help it provides with the creation of components, I just wanted to practice the framework. 

Is this the best approach? I don't think so; other frameworks are available for this purpose. For portfolios, as far as I've read, people are against React.js for its SEO problems. I don't mind, though.

### Changes
Most of the design from the old portfolio were kept. Main changes were made on the landing page, navigation, and buttons.
